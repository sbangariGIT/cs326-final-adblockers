## Study Group ##
### Spring: 2022 ###

#### Overview ####
Our application is a platform for students to find study groups for any of their classes. It allows students to create and join study groups and be part of the discussion. We have started this application from one of the difficulties we faced as freshmen before making our own friend circle. Sometimes your friends do not take the same class as you and it is hard to find the right group to study with. We do have groups on other social media like discord, facebook but what makes us innovative is the ability to get all of them under the same hood so that students do not have to search more for getting any assistance. The application has a very one click register method and you can start joining/creating a required study group. With its easy to use interface you can create a group and specify when and where you plan to meet, if itâ€™s virtual please feel free to drop in the zoom link.

The application also lets you leave and join at your own convenience making the roster of your study groups different each semester. This is an attempt to make more collaborative learning sessions and give students additional resources.
