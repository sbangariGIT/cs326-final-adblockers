#### Overview ####
Our application is a platform for students to find study groups for any of their classes. It allows students to create and join study groups and be part of the discussion. We have started this application from one of the difficulties we faced as freshmen before making our own friend circle. Sometimes your friends do not take the same class as you and it is hard to find the right group to study with. We do have groups on other social media like discord, facebook but what makes us innovative is the ability to get all of them under the same hood so that students do not have to search more for getting any assistance. The application has a very one click register method and you can start joining/creating a required study group. With its easy to use interface you can create a group and specify when and where you plan to meet, if itâ€™s virtual please feel free to drop in the zoom link.

The application also lets you leave and join at your own convenience making the roster of your study groups different each semester. This is an attempt to make more collaborative learning sessions and give students additional resources.

#### User Interface ####

1. Landing Page

<br>This page is the first page that the user sees. Here we have the list of all the study groups and you have opition to navigate to login and sign up. This uses the get command to fetch all the groups 
![picture alt](../images/milestone3/final_landing.png "Landing Page")

2. Login Page

<br>This is where you can login using email and password, if the email does not exist you will get a message saying create an account otherwise, or if the password is incorrect the message would be incorrect password. We store the authentication creditials in our database.

3. Sign Up Page

<br>This is where you can Sign using email and password and other information. You will be redirected to the create page.

![picture alt](../images/milestone3/final_register.png "Register Screen")

4. Profile Page

<br>This is the profile page where the current users details are in here. We have all the groups a user is part of, his notifications and information. We can dismiss the notifications which triggers delete in our database

![picture alt](../images/milestone3/final_profile.png "Profile Page")

5. Create Group Page

<br>This is where you can create a group. This will make a group in our database.

![picture alt](../images/milestone3/final_create.png "Create Group Page")

6. Join Group Page

<br>This is where you can join a group from. This will trigger notification to the user indicating that you joined the group. The groups which you are already part of would not be displayed in this list

7. Edit Profile Page

<br>This the page where you can update users information. This page calls functions to update the database.

![picture alt](../images/milestone3/final_editprof.png "Edit Profile Page")

8. Group Page

<br>This the page for each individual group page. This page loads all the details of a group and lets you leave the group.

#### API's ####
Here is the list of the API's we use

| Type of CRUD | Name of the API | Functionality                                                                                   |

| DELETE       | /deleteNoti     | This function removes the notification after the user deletes it.                               |
| DELETE       | /exitGroup      | This API function removes a user from a certain group given its id.                             |

A detailed utilization of the above are described in URL rounting and mapping.

#### Database ####
We used noSQL database: MongoDB atlas. Here we have two major collections <b>Users</b> and <b>Groups</b>.

1. Users
<br>every document contains the following attributes
<br>_id: Unique Identifier id (Type: Object)
<br>email:  email of a user (Type: String)
<br>password: password of the user (Type: String)
<br>name: name of the user (Type: String)
<br>major: major of the user (Type: String)
<br>cred_level: Freshman | Junior | Senior etc (Type: String)
<br>profile_url: url of the image (Type: String)
<br>notifications: array of notification (Type: Array)

1. Groups
<br>every document contains the following attributes
<br>_id: Unique Identifier id (Type: Object)
<br>class: which class does the group belong (ex: CS 326) (Type: String)
<br>name: name of the group (Type: String)
<br>loc_and_time: location and time of meeting (Type: String)
<br>type: Public | Private
<br>size: max capacity (Type: Number)
<br>members: array of notification (Type: Array)

#### Authentication/Authorization ####

Login Authenitcation:
We are storing the username and password in the database and using that to handle the authentication.

Inside the application:
While we make sure that you connot see any infromation apart from group names, the functionilty of going into a single group page only opens up if a particular user is part of the group.
Hence teven if you copy past a browser url from one browser to another we check if the group id exists for that user before giving him access to the group information. This is the only authorization part of our application. Given that public groups are open one gets admitted into the group as soon as you click join.

### Conclusion ###
The experience of building this application was unique in its own way. We had a good number of ups and downs, for some of the team members it was the first time building a full aplications while for some it was the first web application. We did fill a lot of knowledge gaps on how stuff works in the real world and going from an idea to an application. We did have a huge leraning curve in terms of making design choices and pivoting from one design to another to make the application better. Given more time we defenitly think we can add many more features and grow the application.

Design phase: we realized that this was the most important part of the project as we had to lay the foundation of what comes next. Suprisingly enough we realized that this part requires the least code but the most effort. We spend a good chuck of time on whiteboards rather than laptops to plan things out.

Front-End phase: In this phase we learned about prototyping software like figma and started making wireframes, all of the members were not art enthusiasts hence we had a good number of hours of doing work we did not enjoy. But by the end of it we did find some of our creative brain cells working. We did realise the frontend work is a significant job.

Back-End phase: This part was more of implementing what we already planned given that the structure of milestones went hand in hand with homeworks we just had to convert the backend and connect it to the databse. As we already wrote the structure of our collections and documents we had a smooth ride on this one. Couple of errors but stackoverflow and MongoDB documentation came to the rescue. 

To conclude we have a lot more to talk about web programming than what we had before starting the course, we learned a lot from each other and how to better work in a team environment. We acknowledge that this is just the tip of the ice berg in terms of what web programming is but are glad we could lay the foundation. Thank you all for making this happen!
