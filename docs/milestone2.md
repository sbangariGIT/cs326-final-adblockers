You will be creating a Markdown file called milestone2.md in the docs folder of your github repository. It should contain:

A brief and precise representation of APIs for you application
At least one set of four screenshots of your client interface with descriptions
The URL of your Heroku Application

In addition, your milestone2.md file must contain a breakdown of the division of labor for each team member â€” that is, saying who did what. Remember that everyone is expected to contribute roughly equally to each phase of the project. We expect to see similar numbers and kinds of GitHub commits by each student.
