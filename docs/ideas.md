# Innovative Idea
Our idea: A centralized hub to find study groups and study partners.
The idea is to have list of all the classes taught at UMass and have students the ability to create and join study 
groups. Group can list their meeting time, date and location. Students can also invite members into the group. 
This hub also acts like a resource center where we can store resources for a class.
Each group will have a chat room to discuss.

Groups can make the group private - invite only, public - accept by admin. 

Each user would have a profile page which contains their groups and a personal resource folder.

This idea relates to other products such as OpenStudy, Meetup & Eventbrite because it organizes individuals/group looking to work together towards a common goal and makes the process more streamlined/efficient to do so. It saves users the hassle of figuring out to organize/build groups and lets them focus on the direct work they're aiming to accomplish. Some differences is that our idea is focused on UMass students and the study groups formed within that community so it's catered to a more specific, academic demograpic. See similar product descriptions below.

# Similarly Available Products:

~ OpenStudy - is a social learning network where students around the world ask questions, give help, and connect with other students studying the same things.

~ Meetup - is a platform for finding and building local communities. People use Meetup to meet new people, learn new things and find support.

~ Eventbrite - is a social platform used for hosting and registering for events and is one of the most popular Meetup alternatives. You can create an event, set up seating and ticket pricing, and then put the word out using social media to draw a crowd.
